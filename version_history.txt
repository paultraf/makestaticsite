0.27.7.1 (released on 2023-10-09)
        * Bug fixes *
        [lib/constants.sh]
         Corrected info and description labels for page_element_domains;
         modified options_allow_empty to allow asset_domains to be empty
         during setup.

0.27.7 (released on 2023-10-09)
      * Refined handling of assets from additional domains plus maintenance *
      [lib/constants.sh]
       Augmented asset_extensions with font file extensions;
       Added a new constant, asset_extensions_external, a more limited set
       of file extensions for assets gleaned from external domains
       Added new constant, page_element_domains, to designate domains used
       to construct and style web pages rather than downloadable assets.
       This now assumes the default of auto over asset_domains, which should
       now be a specific list.
      [setup.sh]
       read_config(): when running unattended, check that run level is 0 or
       else abort.
      [makestaticsite.sh]
       initialise_variables(): extended processing to take account of new
       constant, page_element_domains, and revised extra_domains;
       references to extra_domains replaced by asset_domains; 
       generate_extra_domains(): references to extra_domains replaced by
       page_element_domains; extended processing to take account of new
       constant, page_element_domains.
       wget_extra_urls(): cosmetic changes to terminal output;
       modified HTML assets filter to reference page_element_domains.
       site_postprocessing(): Moved code to process asset locations to new
       function, process_assets(); this is called within a new conditional
       that checks whether there are URLs to process or the site URL has a
       path (with assets to gather); for clarity, 'extra_domains_array' label
       replaced by 'extra_domains_array'

0.27.6 (released on 2023-10-05)
      * Maintenance: fixed syntactical issues plus a bit of file management *

       string for array membership
      [makestaticsite.sh]
       Replaced occurrences of touch with touchmod command.

       added function remote_command_prefix() to determine command, protocol
       plus options for executing remote checks (currently only ssh).
      [lib/validate.sh]
       validate_dir(): extended to allow for remote usage
       validate_http(): limited curl status check with limit on number of

       to facilitate remote error trapping.
       wget_mirror(): touch cookie files when not defined.
       clean_mirror(): Added command to remove empty directories.

       assets downloaded by Wget from extra domains now initially moved
       to imports directory (ahead of being moved to assets directory)
       Updated sed replacements accordingly.
       Moved code to generate list of extra domains, extra_domains, to new
       function, generate_extra_domains, called in both wget_extra_urls()
